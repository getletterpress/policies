# 3. Policy Management Policy

Postie implements policies and procedures to maintain compliance and integrity of data. The CTO is responsible for maintaining policies and procedures and assuring all Postie workforce members, business associates, customers, and partners are adherent to all applicable policies. Previous versions of policies are retained to assure ease of finding policies at specific historic dates in time.

## 3.2 Maintenance of Policies

1. All policies are stored and up to date to maintain Postie compliance with HIPAA, HITRUST, and other relevant standards. Updates and version control are done similar to source code control.
2. Policy update requests can be made by any workforce member at any time. Furthermore, all policies are reviewed annually by the CTO to assure they are accurate and up-to-date.
3. Postie employees may request changes to policies using the following process:
  1. The Postie employee initiates a change request by opening a GitHub pull request from a separate branch or repository containing the desired changes.
  2. The CTO is assigned to review the policy change request.
  3. Once the review is completed, the CTO approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
  4. If the review is approved, the CTO then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
  5. If the policy change requires technical modifications to production systems, those changes are carried out by authorized personnel using Postie's [change management process (ยง9.4)](#9.4-changing-existing-systems).
4. All policies are made accessible to all Postie workforce members. The current master policies are published at [https://policy.Postie.com](https://policy.Postie.com).
   * Changes are automatically communicated to all Postie team members through integrations between GitHub and Slack that log all GitHub policy channels to a dedicated Postie Slack Channel.
5. All policies, and associated documentation, are retained for 6 years from the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later
   1. Version history of all Postie policies is done via GitHub.
6. The policies and information security policies are reviewed and audited annually, or after significant changes occur to Postie's organizational environment. Issues that come up as part of this process are reviewed by Postie management to assure all risks and potential gaps are mitigated and/or fully addressed. The process for reviewing polices is outlined below:
  1. The CTO initiates the policy review.
  2. The CTO is assigned to review the current Postie policies ([https://policy.Postie.com/](https://policy.Postie.com/)).
  3. If changes are made, the above process is used. All changes are documented in the Issue.
  4. Once the review is completed, the CTO approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
  5. If the review is approved, the CTO then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.

Additional documentation related to maintenance of policies is outlined in [ยง5.3.1](#5.3-security-officer).
