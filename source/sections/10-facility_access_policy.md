# 10. Facility Access Policy

Postie works with AWS to assure restriction of physical access to systems used as part of the Postie Platform. AWS controls access to the physical buildings/facilities that house these systems/applications in accordance to the HIPAA Security Rule 164.310 and its implementation specifications. In an effort to safeguard ePHi from unauthorized access, tampering, and theft, access is allowed to hosting areas only to those persons authorized to be in them.
