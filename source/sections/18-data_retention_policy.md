# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Postie understand and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Postie is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Postie has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Postie Customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 State Medical Record Laws
